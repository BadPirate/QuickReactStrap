# Basic Web App

This project is a basic web app project.  It's based on react starter kit, with some simplification in configuration.

## Getting Started

1. Update .env to reflect details
2. Update package.json to reflect app name
3. Make your app!

## Included beyond create-react-app

1. `eslint` - I've got this configured the only way that matters (DEATH TO SEMICOLONS!) but feel free to mess it up.
